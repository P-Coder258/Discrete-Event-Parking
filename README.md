# Parking Lot Simulation

## Overview
This project is a **parking lot simulation** using **discrete event simulation (DES)** to model vehicle arrivals, parking, and departures. The goal is to analyze parking lot efficiency, occupancy rates, and wait times using Python.

## Implementation Goals
- Model a parking lot system with **capacity constraints** and **vehicle queues**.
- Simulate **random vehicle arrivals and departures** over a set duration.
- Track **key metrics** such as occupancy rates and waiting times.
