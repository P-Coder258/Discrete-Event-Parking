# Discrete-Event-Parking

# Parking Lot Simulation

## Overview
This project is a **Parking Lot Simulation** using **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** to model vehicle arrivals, parking, and departures. The goal is to analyze parking lot efficiency, occupancy rates, and wait times using Python.

## Implementation Goals
- Model a parking lot system with **capacity constraints** and **vehicle queues**.
- Simulate **random vehicle arrivals and departures** over a set duration.
- Track **key metrics** such as occupancy rates and waiting times.
- Implement **a UML-based design** for modularity and scalability.
- Provide **future extensibility** for smart parking or dynamic pricing.
